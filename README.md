This project conducts a comprehensive study of coffee worldwide from 1990-2019. Utilizing data science techniques, we identify the countries with the largest inventories each year, revealing significant trends and insights for stakeholders in the global coffee industry.
Welcome to our exciting endeavour into the world of coffee - the commodity that fuels our mornings and economies alike. This project takes you on a journey through the global dynamics of coffee, encompassing its import, export, consumption, and production from 1990 to 2019.
​
Beyond being a beloved beverage, coffee plays a crucial role in the world economy. It is the second most traded commodity globally after oil, making it a significant player in international trade.
Moreover, its production forms the backbone of the economy in many countries, especially in regions like Central and South America, Africa, and parts of Asia. Simultaneously, consumption patterns reveal fascinating sociocultural trends across different societies and economies.
​
My study delves deep into these aspects, decoding patterns and trends that have shaped the coffee industry. We use advanced data science techniques to investigate the countries with the most significant inventories, highest consumption, and annual changes.
​
We will also focus on the import-export balance of different countries, helping us understand the supply-demand dynamic better.

Stay tuned as we embark on this caffeinated journey, revealing the intricate tapestry of the global coffee trade and consumption!
